<h1>BT Snooper</h1>

This is a simple PoC android application to demonstrate the risks pertaining to allowing installation of any application on a rooted device.
As of now, the app performs a "cat" operation to read any file in the android system, and as it assumes superuser role, it can read any app's
internal files (eg. /data/data/com.something.interesting/Logs/log.txt).

* No prerequisites for installation. 
* Android Kitkat and above supported.
